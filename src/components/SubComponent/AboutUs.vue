                    <p> CITAD is a non-governmental and non-profit organization that is committed to the use of information and 
                    communication technologies for development and promotion of good governance.It was 
                    established first as a single project (Computer Literacy Project) in 1996 but was 
                    expanded in 2000 to include other projects. Now it incorporates six different thematic units.</p>

                    <p>CITAD sees technology as tool to promote sustainable development, good government and peaceful coexistence. 
                    It uses ICT to empower youth and women through access to information, skills and 
                    online mentoring opportunities. It utilises such platforms such as social networking, 
                    web-to-text interface and tools such as Google alert to provide information that would 
                    promote peaceful coexistence. It uses Google alerts to source information about 
                    trends of discussion in various platforms, sites and online discussion lists and 
                    sites with a view to understanding treads, attitudes and positions such that it can develop 
                    appropriate responses to those that are similarly disseminated to either reinforce positive 
                    trends or counter and neutralize negative ones.</p>

                    outreach units located in Gombe , Yobe and Bauchi States.</p>
